# Car-Dealership
(Very) Small team project for learning a few features of C++. The "dealership" has a client and a manager. The manager can do CRUD operations on cars. 
The client can view cars, filter them (only by using the console view) and sort them according to any of their attributes. We used the MVC pattern for
this project. The graphical interface was created using Qt Creator.
