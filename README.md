# Car-Dealership
(Very) Small team project for learning a few features of C++. The "dealership" has a client and a manager. The manager can do CRUD operations on cars. 
The client can view cars and sort them according to any of their attributes. We used the MVC pattern for this project. The graphical interface was 
created using Qt Creator.
