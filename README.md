# Car-Dealership
(Very) Small team project for learning a few features of C++. The "dealership" has a client and a manager. The manager can do CRUD operations on cars. 
The client can view cars, filter them (only by using the console view) and sort them according to any of their attributes. The changes can be stored 
either in an in-memory repository or in a csv-file repository. We used the MVC pattern for this project. The graphical interface was created using Qt
Creator.
